> **Abstract:** Scholars, policy makers, and journalists are requesting comprehensive information about the geographic locations, religious services, and socio-economic environments of Chinese religions. As an effort to promote international collaborations on spatial studies of Chinese religions and society, a spatial information network for the studies of Christianity in China has been established by a group of scholars from several institutions in the U.S. and China. The objectives of the project include: (1) to establish a centralized information infrastructure; (2) to provide effective tools and technical support for interested users through spatial intelligence information technology; (3) to create an online research forum designed to promote information sharing and improve understanding of Christianity in China; and (4) to render comprehensive information about teaching, learning, and training on the studies of Chinese Christianity. This paper will present some results from the project, including an online spatial information platform, which will integrate data, methodology and research references for the studies of Chinese Christianity. This paper will discuss the information structure, methodology, and technology applied in this system. The system allows easy access to comprehensive demographic, economic, and religious information in China as well as some online tools for spatial data analysis. It will demonstrate how space-time data of different formats and sources can be integrated, visualized, and reported in a web based system for religious studies. Some case studies for Chinese religions and future directions will be discussed.

> **Abstract:** 
The new generation of information technology, represented by Internet of things, mobile internet, cloud computing and big data, has been developed rapidly, it has a great impact on various aspects of urban and rural governance, it also brings big challenge into land use and urban planning information management. From the perspective of life cycle management of land, this paper takes Wuhan Land Use Integrated Management Information System as an example, to put forward the basic ideas on building a big data platform of land use and urban planning. It mainly introduced the basic means of land management and urban planning data acquisition, construction of platform, public participation and supervision. The platform could provide a strong support for urban land assets management, project implementation, space structure optimization of urban land and function.
以物联网、移动互联网、云计算和大数据为代表的新一代信息技术的迅速发展, 深刻地影响着城乡治理的方方面面，对土地和规划信息化管理工作也提出了更高要求。本文从土地生命周期业务管理的角度出发，以武汉市土地利用综合管理信息系统为例，提出了构建土地和规划管理大数据平台的基本思路，重点介绍了土地管理和城市规划数据获取的基本手段、平台体系建设、公众参与和监督。该平台将为城市土地资产经营、项目实施、城市用地空间布局和功能结构优化提供强有力的支撑

> **Abstract:** 道路网模式中的平行路段作为一种局部模式,其识别与简化是地图综合研究的重要内容。本文在分析平行路段产生的原因和常见形态后,给出一种利于简化的平行路段分类方法,并提出基于平头缓冲区搜寻备选平行路段进而利用平行性测度判断路段是否平行的方法。在此基础上,针对3类平行路段分别提出对应的几何化简与连通关系简化方法。实验结果表明,该识别与简化方法能够对路网模式中的平行路段进行有效地综合,具有一定的实用价值,对进一步研究具有参考价值。

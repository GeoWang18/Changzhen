* **Wuhan City Prosperity Initiative (Wuhan CPI)** (http://cpi.unhabitat.org/) \ 
   This program aims to measure and monitor sustainable urban development spatially and comparably for city authorities to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention from six dimensions: productivity, infrastructure development, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, environmental sustainability, urban governance and legislation. \
**Key achievements**:
* Interpreted 61 indicators to adapt Chinese context and collected about 85% data.
* Assessed spatial datasets to support spatial capital model and analyzed spatial statistical indicators from the Atlas of Urban Expansion based on New York University.
* Presented urban development challenges in Wuhan, the main activities of WLSP and designed the survey questionnaire to improve the understanding of the priority areas of Wuhan accompanying benefits and challenges through professional opinions to address the introduction and objective of the CPI report. 
* Compared other city indexes to explore advantages and innovations of CPI based on the connections between the CPI, SDGs and the New Urban Agenda. 
* Assisted the Wuhan team to understand the definition, standardization, and calculation of CPI indicators and spatial indicators technically, revised SDGs indicators metadata, including land consumption rate, land allocated to the street, housing affordability.

**Development Engineer, WLSP, China**，5/2014-6/2017
   **1. Advanced Spatial Analysis of Urban Buildings** (http://tdjg.wlsp.org.cn) \
   This program focuses on exploring the distributions and interactions between buildings, populations, public facilities, and urban planning to assist the city decision-makers to improve housing affordability and public facility allocation. 
**Key achievements**:
* Built up data models to analyze the spatial distribution of 286,844 buildings in Wuhan, and identify the unbalanced areas of planning and practical buildings. 
* Applied spatial data analysis and spatial statistics to explore and visualize trends and relationships between buildings, populations, transportation, and public facilities.
* Processed and aggregated 14 spatial datasets to extract indicators of density and FAR, tall building, etc., including eliminating topology errors, checking data quality, creating geoprocessing workflows, importing them into database and publishing web services.
* Integrated data models to the land use platform and participated in the presentation.

   **2. Land Use Integrated Management Information System** (http://tdjg.wlsp.org.cn) \
   This novel web-based system aims to provide large-scale data and powerful tools for urban planners and city manager to analyze and visualize land use and urban planning issues. Currently, it has 148 layers, 12 tools and 100 active group users from 40 institutions. \
**Key achievements**:
* Created a Five-Year Plan to upgrade the framework and redesigned its architecture and database distribution with other 10 sub-systems to boost the performance.
* Explored the whole life cycle of land management and built up models to monitor parcel status from site selection to building authorization with use right transfer. 
* Processed data from cadaster, urban planning, population, housing building, road and transportation, and other geographic information, including data editing, topology elimination, format conversion, coordinate transformation, and projection.
* Programmed tools to gather open data and display, query and visualize it into maps.

   **3. One Map of Wuhan Econ Tech. Development Zone** (http://119.97.209.18/jkyzt/) \     
   The system integrates multi-source data from Wuhan Econ & Tech. Development Zone into one map, and provide technical support for decision-makers to track the changes of approval and illegal land use for housing and road. \
**Key achievements**:
* Worked on system design, wrote technical documents and presented progress.
* Processed data and managed database for publishing various web services.
* Studied algorithms to monitor how many approval parcels were supplied and used.
* Developed tools to execute spatial operations for automatic visualization and tabulation of statistics, tested and maintained the system, checked data security and fixed bugs.

   **1. Spatial Study of Religion** (http://chinadataonline.org/religionclient/).
* Researched the methodology, data, technology, and framework with spatial thinking and intelligent analysis for Spatial Study of Religion. 
* Classified 72, 968 officially religious sites to Christianity, Buddhism, Islamism, and Taoism on the province, prefecture, county, and township level per year, and integrated more than 100 variables from economic census and population census in China. 
* Imported data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS and published web services.
* Designed and developed spatial explorer of religion with functions of various reports, quick search, location analysis, trend analysis, graphics analysis, spatial statistics, theme map rendering and multi-format data export. 
* Integrated Moran’s I, Geary’s C, Gi, and Moran scatter plot with spatial weight matrix and hypothesis test into the platform and dynamically visualize the computation results with various map and charts. 
* Analyzed interactions between Christianity and Buddhism and detected hot spots.
* Assisted other team members with GIS and spatial analysis.
